"""Ambiguity scoring module for requirement clarity assessment.

This module implements ambiguity measurement for interview states, determining
when requirements are clear enough (score <= 0.2) to proceed with Seed generation.

The scoring algorithm evaluates three key components:
- Goal Clarity (40%): How well the goal statement is defined
- Constraint Clarity (30%): How clearly constraints are specified
- Success Criteria Clarity (30%): How measurable the success criteria are
